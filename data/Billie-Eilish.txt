I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you (Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I

I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('Til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('Til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('Til the day that I die)
But if it's forever, it's even better

I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised17Embed137 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisDeutschPortuguêsРусский日本語PolskiItalianoTürkçeGuess featuring Billie Eilish Lyrics
Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song12Embed135 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoPolskiالعربيةHebrewPortuguêsTürkçeEspañolΕλληνικάDeutschFrançaisРусскийBahasa IndonesiaУкраїнськаNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)Dansk한국어LUNCH Lyrics
Oh, mm-mm

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair

Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

She's takin' pictures in the mirror
Oh my God, her skin's so clear
Tell her, "Bring that over here"
You need a seat? I'll volunteer
Now she's smilin' ear to ear
She's the headlights, I'm the deer

I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
I'm interested in more than just bein' your friend
I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
Do you know how to bend?

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow)
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow

Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Me

Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

And that's when you found me

I was waitin' in the garden
Contemplatin', beg your pardon
But there's a part of me that recognizes you
Do you feel it too?
When you told me it was serious
Were you serious? Mm
They told me they were only curious
Now it's serious, mm
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

Wringing my hands in my lap
And they tell me it's all been a trap
And you don't know if you'll make it back
I said, "No, don't say that"

(Wringing my hands in my lap)

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm

Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn’t mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life

Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine

It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately (Bum, bum, bum)

But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie (Told you a lie)
When I said you (I said you)
You (You) were the love of my life

So you found her, now go fall in love (Go fall in love)
Just like we were if I ever was (If I ever was)
It's not my fault, I did what I could (Did what I could)
You made it so hard like I knew you would

Thought I was depressed or losing my mind
My stomach upset almost all of the time
But after I left, it was obvious why (Oh), mm
Because for you, you
I was the love of your life, mm
But you were not mine (But you were not mine)

It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on, then you moved on
Then you moved on, then you moved on
Then you moved on, then you moved on

Ooh
You wanted to keep it
Like somethin' you found
'Til you didn't need it
But you should've seen it
The way it went down
Wouldn't believe it
Wanna know what I told her
With her hand on my shoulder?
You were so mediocre
And we're so glad it's over now
It's over now
It's over now
It's over now

Mm, mm, mm

I try to live in black and white, but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true (Blue)
And I'm still so blue, oh

I thought we were the same
Birds of a feather, now I'm ashamed
I told you a lie, désolée, mon amour
I'm tryin' my best, don't know what's in store
Open up the door (Blue)
In the back of my mind, I'm still overseas
A bird in a cage, thought you were made for me

I try (I'm not what) to live in black and white, but I'm so blue (But I'm not what you need)
I'd like (Not what you need) to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true, true
And I'm still so bluе (And it's not true)

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

You were born bluer than a butterfly
Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
Colder than your father's eyes
He never learned to sympathize with anyone

I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you (Don't hate you)
But we can't save you (But we can't save you)

You were born reachin' for your mother's hands
Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
Too afraid to step outside
Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard
But they could say the same 'bout me
I sleep 'bout three hours each night
Means only twenty-one a week now, now
And I could say the same 'bout you
Born blameless, grew up famous too
Just a baby born blue now, now

I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you
But we can't save you
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)

But when can I hear the next one?12Embed
