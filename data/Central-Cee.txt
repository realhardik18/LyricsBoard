I'm not in the mood 'cause my flight delayed
So I jumped on a private jet and I'm askin' the pilot the ETA
Lambo' parked on the landin' strip, everyone in my gang and my DJ paid
Why's my man talkin' 'bout inshallah? These times, he don't even pray
Why's my man wearing a Jesus piece?
How does she squeeze in them jeans? Big behind and petitest waist
Take time with the GBG, we don't beef nobody like GBK
Woke up on the wrong side of bed, so he's gonna gеt slapped if I don't have my P's today
I love my young boy, I won't lеad him 'stray, I'm stuck to Lil' Bro like PVA
Paid already, I don't need no hit song
We don't need ID, Lil' Bro seventeen in the club, he ain't scrollin' TikTok
F's just saw him a thick one, "Which one? Who do you want, bro? Pick one"
If I shoot my shot, I'll hit one, matter of time 'til I get them all ticked off
Alright

We can go band for band
Fuck that, we can go M for M
Quarter mil' for the Maybach truck
Double R with the factory rims
I got the 90, the Urus, the Virgil, the Brabus, I'm really a threat
It's got to the point that I don't even care
I got jewels in the safe that I don't even wear

Uh, bro'll do it for some shoes and some clothes, you'll see what he'll do for a necklace
'Rari truck look like a spider, it's crawlin' a dollar on just accessories (Damn)
She made me wanna go harder, I like her whole aura, I think I'm obsessed with her
They hit him up on his birthday, did him the worst way, he had a death wish
I get right under they skin, I don't even try, I guess I can't help that shit
I'ma have love for bro for life if we talk or not, I step with him
Of course you can beat me at talkin', ain't no back-and-forth, wait 'til we catch up with 'em
Knockin' a bag and makin' the opposite mad, I done fell in love with it
UK Selfridges with a cute one (Ooh)
Bank account look good, this a new one (Yeah)
You the type like to type on computers (Wow)
Got a mask, but he ain't no shooter (Haha)
Top ten, but she don't act bougie
Me and your friends can go to Aruba
Hit France, it depend on my mood
This a Maybach Benz, this ain't no Uber
We can go band for band
Fuck that, we can go M for M
Mama got a body like Kim and 'em
Mama been killin' that gym
We can go watch for watch, from chain to chain, the rings, I'm him
I done got rich, but I'm still with the shit, land in London and go to the ends

The mandem too inconsiderate, five-star hotel, smokin' cigarette
Mixin' codeine up with the Phenergan
She got thick, but she wanna get thin again
Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' Skim 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright, I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious
I went from the Toyota Yaris to Urus, they had their chance but blew it
Now this gyal wan' me in her uterus, fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (Fuck it)

Take a look at these diamonds wrong, it's a life of squintin', can't just stare
With bae through thick and thin
She already thick, so I'm halfway there (Hahaha)
Brown and bad, couldn't change my mind, I was halfway there
One hundred meters, huh
I just put nine gyal in a Sprinter (Uh)
One hundred eaters, they won't fit in one SUV, nah
SOS, somebody rescue me
I got too many gyal, too many-many gyal, I got

Pistol came on a Irish ferry, let go and it sound like a tap dance (Bap)
The way that I ball, no yellow
The ref haffa give me a black card
Who did what we doin' with rap?
Man couldn't sell out his show after all them years of doin' the cap
Sprinter, two gyal in a van
Inter, two man in Milan, heard one of my tings datin' P. Diddy
Need twenty percent of whatever she bags
Outside, my head in my hands

I told her my name is Cench, she said, "No, the one on your birth certificate," uh
Your boyfriend ran from the diamond test 'cause they weren't legitimate, nah
She Turkish-Cypriot, but her curves Brazilian, uh
I want her, and bro wants her affiliate
I'm cheap, still hit a chick like, "Yo, can I borrow your Netflix?"
She a feminist, she think I'm sexist
Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta' password, I'll give you the pin to my Amex, huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum
Dinner table, I got manners, huh
T-shirt tucked in, napkin
"Still loading," that's the caption, I've only amounted a minimal fraction
Eat good, I got indigestion
Bare snow in my hood, no Aspen, can't get rid of my pain with Aspirin
Dave just came in an Aston, I'm makin' that Maybach music (M-Maybach Music)
They're tryna insult my intelligence, sometimes, I may act stupid
I never went uni, I been on the campus sellin' cocaine to students
If bro let the drumstick beat, then somethin' gon' leak
We ain't playin' exclusives

Fire for a wife beater, can't rock with that, I ain't wearin' a vest
Man have to send her therapy, she got the E-cup bra, a lot on her chest
I'm in Jamaica, Oracabess'
Hit a lick, went Cash Converters
That don't work, it's pawn, no chess
I'm doin' more and talkin' less
I love chillin' with broke bitches, man book one flight, and they're all impressed (Alright)
I'm in the G63, the car hug me like a friend through twist and turns
Man livin' for nyash and dyin' for nyash
It's fucked, don't know which one's worse, I'm fucked
Bags in his and hers, what's hers is hers, what's mine is too
Heard that girl is a gold digger, it can't be true if she dated you
AP baby blue, paper's pink, I'd probably hate me too
You ever spent six figures and stared at bae like, "Look what you made me do"?
Yeah, alright, started with a Q, didn't wait in line
Weird, I'm askin' my Blasian one, "Why you so focused on your Asian side?"

How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day

Somebody tell Doja Cat that I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit, see the bulge in that
See the motion clap when you're throwin' it back (When you're throwin' it back)
These females plannin' on doin' me wrong
So I'm grabbin' a 'dom out the Trojan pack
Post the location after we're gone
Can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you, but I valuе my life (But I value my life)
'Causе imagine I die (Die)
And I ain't made a hundred Ms yet
There's so much things I ain't done yet
Like fuckin' a flight attendant, huh
I don't party, but I heard Cardi there, so fuck it, I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life would've been if I never did take them risks and would have I prospered?
Floatin' and I won't go under
Been outta town for a month
Absence made the love grow fonder
UK rap or UK drill, gotta mention my name if you talk 'bout the genre (Alright)

When our children ask us how did we meet, I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love
FYP love, IG love"

My crisis ain't from cost of living
I think 'bout death like, "God forbid it"
American Express got no limit
Career consists of lots of women
How can I convince you I'm not the villain?
Shit's dramatic like opera singin'
Down on one knee, I got a proposition
In the past I was not consistent
Out of these girls, you're top division
Can't downgrade and lower my standard
When I first saw you on the 'Gram, bae, I was in awe and showin' the mandem
Askin' advice, "How can I slide in there?"
Usin' words not my usual language
I clocked that you just came out of a breakup
Been on your social media ranting
Slid up and replied to your story, you ain't responded, I wanna unsend it
Got me stalkin' your Facebook page and preeing your friends list
Saw that you followed a fellow acquaintance
You ain't even mine, yet I'm feelin' envious
Promiscuous chick make me wanna risk it, I like how you're real uncensored

When our children ask us how did we meet
I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love, FYP love, IG love"
Saw her on the Explore Page, like, I need to explore deeper
Suggested accounts said that we got mutuals
But you don't fuck with them, me neither
When I'm with you, I get baby fever
I met your mum on the FYP
We're young and our love's Gen Z
Mum said that it ain't gon' last
I'm tellin' her, "We gon' see"
They say our relationship is childish
You're my baby, so I agree
Started with an IG like
Now you're down to ride, just like a G

If it weren't for the algorithm, I wouldn't have found my woman
We're messin' around and act like kids, give me a nostalgic feelin'
Took you on all of them trips, now you got my accountant trippin'
Sent you a thousand roses, not like you're local, a thousand miles I've driven
You ain't even gave me the ick yet, I ain't even seen red flags yet
Get mad and you call me a dickhead, got me addicted, feel like a crackhead
Passenger seat just givin' me side-eye, it's giving main-character syndrome
You ain't gotta connect to the Wi-Fi, let's just talk and put down the iPhone
She liked my post, I liked her post
Love at first sight, love at first scroll
I ain't perfect, I'm tryna learn though
I hope it's worth it when we turn old
Still recoverin', I'm not okay
So I'm paranoid that she won't stay
I might catch a whine, this ain't Soul Train
I'm afraid this ain't like the old days
When our children ask us how did we meet
I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love, FYP love, IG love"
Saw her on the Explore Page, like, I need to explore deeper

Eight cribs to my name, and a couple AMG's
Sеnd your allocation, put your addy in my navigation
She a baddie, got my validation, say your body need examination
Say you want vacation, then we ain't goin' Afro Nation
I'd rather fly you out to Naij, put you on a flight
Knowin’ you, probably try and argue in the sky
Bae, I’d rather lie than see you cry
We can start a family, but you don't trust men, you had no father in your life
More money, less clout

Good karma keep comin' in clutch

Only hate the roads when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You said that pussy mine, so why'd you let it go?
Haha, you're such a ho

I loved you until you try to get in my head
And that's why I lost respect
You're doin' the most to get my attention, baby, I'm not impressed, uh
I changed my bedsheets, but I still smell your flesh
I don't know how we got in this mess
I rarely get this in-depth
This girl make me question love
This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us
The last time that we fucked was fucked, the way you got up, got dressed and cut
Look, I thought that we could've been
Maybe, I was too optimistic
Tell me what you need, I'll provide everythin'
Baby, you don't know what you're missin'
Our chemistry felt like quantum physics, physics
Feelin' your energy, feelin' your spirit
If this is the end, I need one more visit
They're showin' me love, but I still feel empty
I need somethin' a lot more fulfillin', uh
Move out of London town then move to a rural village
You made me delete that pic off my phone
But I close my eyes, still see that image
