Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
When the clouds come, we go, we Roc-A-Fella (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?  (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)

You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together, we'll mend your heart because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So, gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy

Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy

All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh
The reason I hold on
Ooh
'Cause I need this hole gone
Well, funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay

I want you to stay

Mustard on the beat, ho!

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
